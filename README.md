# About the repository
This programming resource contains the Gauss Elimination handler implementing in the C programming language. In addition, it also has the parallelized resource using OpenMP and MPI. Parallelization in different OpenMP was done in three ways, namely: The first uses the opm for directive, the second uses the same directive but with shedule dynamic and the third uses the taskloop directive.

# About the article
An article was made to present the problem of Gaussian Elimination facing in parallelization, and also no document obtained (execution time and speedup) can be seen.
